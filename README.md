# üó∫Ô∏è How New York Plans to Build Its Renewable Future

This interactive map visualizes New York Power Authority's (NYPA) first slate of renewable energy projects, including solar and battery developments across the state. Each circle represents a project site, sized by its energy capacity and color-coded by project type and development status.

Built using **Mapbox GL JS**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this map was developed as part of the Web Mapping course at NYU Wagner, taught by Chris Whong.

## Features

- Interactive Mapbox GL JS visualization  
- Visual encoding of project type (solar, battery) and status (ready, under review, planned)  
- Clickable markers to reveal project details  
- Legend with size and color indicators  
- Clear headline and subhead designed for integration in storypages

## Ideas for Improvement

- **Hover functionality**: Display key project info (e.g., name, capacity, status) on hover instead of requiring clicks  
- **Responsive/mobile deployment**: Optimize map controls and layout for mobile users  
- **Story integration**: Use this map as a module in a larger storypage, with legends and copy placed externally for better UX  
- **Filters**: Add toggles to view only solar or battery, or by development stage
